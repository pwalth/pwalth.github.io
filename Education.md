I've had a very stem focused education so far, and I do not expect that to change. In high school, along with normal AP math and science classes, I took a 3 year engineering program that focused on problem solving and real world applications, and I use skills from those classes to this day. In college, my main classes have been the general chemistry and physics classes, both passed with high grades, as well as quantatative analysis, and the organic chemistry series.

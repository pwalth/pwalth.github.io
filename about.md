Hi! My name I'm Peter Walther, a college sophomore majoring in biochemistry and physics. My goal is to work in a research based academic field, ideally as an astronaut. I've had many odd jobs and a lot of experience in many different tasks from customer service, to sailing, to chemistry lab construction. I've always been a person who wants to know why things are the way they are, and I hope both in school and life that is always the case.
